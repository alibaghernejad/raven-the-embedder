# Raven â€“ The Embedder

**Raven-The-Embedder** is a core component of the broader **Retraven** project, though it can also be used as a standalone module, serving as a launchpad, playground, or base for other embedding-driven applications.

This module leverages **Python** along with **Qdrant** as the vector database, integrating powerful text and image embedding models. A complete **data ingestion pipeline** is included, with built-in support for **MinIO** (an S3-compatible object storage system) and **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous task handling.
